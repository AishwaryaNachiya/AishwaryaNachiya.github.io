## Work Experience

### Data Science Internship

**Position:** Data Analysis Intern  
**Company:** GlobalMedics.AI  
**Duration:** January 2024 - June 2024

During my internship at GlobalMedics.AI, I had the opportunity to work on innovative projects that utilized advanced AI technologies to enhance healthcare documentation processes. My primary focus was on developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for generating pre-consultation reports from medical records. This experience allowed me to blend my data science skills with practical applications in the healthcare sector.

**Key responsibilities included:**

- **Data Extraction and Processing:** Implemented the Azure Form Recognizer client library to automate the extraction of structured data from unstructured medical documents. This involved using pre-built layout and general document models to gather essential patient information, thereby improving workflow efficiency.
  
- **PII Detection and Redaction:** Developed scripts utilizing the Azure AI Text Analytics package to detect and redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from medical records. This critical task ensured compliance with data privacy regulations, reinforcing the company's commitment to patient confidentiality.
  
- **LangChain Integration:** Completed a course on "LangChain Chat with Your Data," which equipped me with essential skills in text preprocessing, tokenization, and normalization. I applied these techniques to enhance the performance of our RAG model, ensuring the generated reports were both accurate and relevant.
  
- **RAG Framework Implementation:** Studied and applied concepts from the "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Using Azure and LangChain Tutorial," successfully integrating external data sources into our RAG framework. This integration improved the model's ability to generate personalized and contextually relevant pre-consultation reports.

Throughout my internship, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team, contributing to a project that significantly improved healthcare documentation workflows. This experience not only deepened my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to leveraging data science in real-world applications to enhance operational efficiency and patient care.
